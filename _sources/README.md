# Front Matter

Parallel programming is an essential part of producing and analysing large scale datasets in the Climate and Weather space.

This website contains collected notes on parallel programming in climate science, by the ARC Centre for Excellence in Climate Extremes' Computational Modelling Systems Team (CLEX CMS). The primary focus of this work is data analysis using Python on gridded datasets, but we will also somewhat cover how parallel programming is used in climate and weather modelling using Fortran.

We aim for the notebooks here to be executable using Binder (the rocket button in the top left of pages) using publically available data, however especially for large dataset demonstrations we may use files stored at [NCI](https://nci.org.au). Those with NCI accounts can start a Jupyter session on VDI or Gadi using the scripts at https://github.com/coecms/nci_scripts.
